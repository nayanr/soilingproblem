Evaluation of factors affecting soiling


LOCATION -  Region where the plant has been established. For example, soiling will obviously be larger at places which are closed to deserts than places which are close to sea-shores.

SEASON - The season which we are talking about, the dust will not be same in every season so that can also be possible parameter while discussing the soiling problem. Like rainy season dust is less but also not enough daylight is available so we have to consider gain estimation for our calculation here.

WEATHER â€“ The amount of daylight an area is receiving and the amount which is spend on taking its care.
